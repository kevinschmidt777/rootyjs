# RootyJS
RootyJS is a Node.js framework for building modern APIs. Written in TypeScript and based on Fastify. 

The idea behind RootyJS is to provide a real simple and clean boilerplate solution for your next Node.js API. There are only a few things included and prepaired, which you really need to get your project started. Without the overhead of many other frameworks!

It also comes with a few basic settings you always need and a folder structure with some demo files and data. Those will help you get started even faster.

Since RootyJS is based on Fastify, it gives you amazing performance for your server requests and responses. Many benchmark results shows, that Fastify is up to 2x faster than Express. Oh, and by the way, it can handle more than 50.000 requests per second.

## What is included?
Fastify - the kernel system RootyJS is based on.

Sequelize - easy communication with Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server.

Jest - for writing unit tests.

Nodemon - monitoring and auto-refreshs your development environment on the fly.

Prettier - clean formatting your source code.

## Requirements
